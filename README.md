These are my solutions to some of the problems of [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/).

Project Euler is used by me as a means to learn [Clojure](http://clojure.org/).
Feel free to look at the solutions, but if you not already solved them yourself
and do not like spoilers, please think again before looking further.

To run the solutions:

1. Install [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Go to <code>project-euler-solutions/clojure</code> and run <code>lein test</code>.
